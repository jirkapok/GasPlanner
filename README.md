## Prerequisites

To work on the application install NodeJs, AngularCli and TypeScript. Recommended development environment is Visual Studio Code. On Windows you can use `build/installEnvironment.ps1` to get initial environment tools and packages, or you can use Github Codespaces for a ready-to-go hosted development environment.

## Build

To compile the application, first you need to install the dependencies from local directory. To do so run `npm run build-lib`.
Than compile solution by `npm run build` to deploy `dist` directory. To start the app use `npm start` for debugging purpose. See also `build/build.ps1` build script on Windows.
Development state of the art can also be checked using Github Actions:

## Running the tests

Angular recommended testing environment is used, to run test use `npm run test-lib`, `npm test`. To test the progressive web application behavior use `npm run start-pwa`.
