# Environment

* `Salinity`: Because salinity of water changes its density and it means also pressure of the water column at depth. In result it affects the tissues loading. See also wiki for [brine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine). Eg. 22 meters (73 ft) corresponds to 3.222 bar (46.7 psi) in salt water. You can choose from fresh water, salt (sea) water and Brackish (EN13319) water. Brackish water is somewhere between salt and fresh. It is used by some computers as the only one option (Suunto). In case your dive computer doesn't contain Brackish water use salt water (value with higher content of salt).

| Salinity | Location | Salinity [gram/liter] | Density [kg/m3] |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Salt | Red sea, Mediterranean sea | 38 | 1028 |
| Brackish (EN13319) | Black sea, Baltic sea | 28 | 1020 |
| Fresh | Lakes | 0.1 | 1000 |

* `Altitude`: Similar effect on decompression like salinity has diving at higher altitude. The higher you are, the lower is the atmospheric pressure around you. 0 m.a.s.l. means sea level, e.g. 1.0132 bar. Diving at higher altitude results in higher decompression (e.g. shorten no decompression limit).

| Altitude [m.a.s.l.] | Imperial [f.a.s.l.] | Air pressure [bar] |
| ---  | ---  | ---  |
| 0    | 0    | 1.01 |
| 400  | 1312 | 0.97 |
| 700  | 2297 | 0.93 |
| 2000 | 6562 | 0.79 |
