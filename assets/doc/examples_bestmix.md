# Example Nitrox best mix calculation

## Formulas

depth pressure = convert maximum operational depth to pressure

O2 fraction in mix = partial pressure O2 / maximum operational depth pressure 

## Example

What is the best mix (in percents) at partial pressure 1.4 at depth 30 m?

Pressure at depth = 30 / 10 + 1 = 4 bar

O2 fraction in mix = 1.4 / 4 = 0.35

Percent O2 in mix => 0.35 => 35 % O2 (Ean35)
