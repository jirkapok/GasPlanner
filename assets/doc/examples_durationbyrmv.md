# Example Duration of dive by available gas calculation

## Formulas

SAC =  RMV / tank size

duration = consumed gas / (average depth in bars * SAC)


## Example

How long can i stay (in minutes) at average depth 15 m with available 150 b in 10 L tank, where my respiratory minute volume (RMV) is 20 L/min?

During dive where average depth was 15 meters for 45 minutes i consumed 150 bars from 15 liter tank. What is my SAC and RMV?

depth in bars =  15 / 10 + 1 = 2.5 bar (simplified depth conversion)

SAC = 20 / 10 = 2 bar/minute

duration = 150 / (2 * 2.5) = 30 minutes
