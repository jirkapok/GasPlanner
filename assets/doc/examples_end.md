# Example Equivalent narcotic depth calculations

## Formulas

Equivalent narcotic depth = (1 - Helium fraction) * depth


## Example

You plan a dive to 45 meters. Team selects Trimix 21/35 as a gas for the dive. What is the equivalent narcotic depth for this gas?

Helium fraction = 0.35

Pressure at depth 45 m => 5.5 b

Equivalent narcotic depth = (1 - 0.35) * 5.5 = 0.65 * 5.5 = 3.58 bar => 25.8 meters
