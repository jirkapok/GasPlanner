# Example equivalent narcotic depth calculations

## Formulas

Maximum narcotic depth = narcotic depth limit / (1 - Helium fraction)


## Example

You plan a dive and consider Air narcotic for depths below 30 meters. 
Team selects Trimix 21/35 as a gas. What is the maximum narcotic depth for this gas?

Helium fraction = 0.35

Pressure at narcotic depth 30 m => 4 b

Maximum narcotic depth = 4 / (1 - 0.35) = 4 / 0.65 = 6.15 b => 51.5 meters
