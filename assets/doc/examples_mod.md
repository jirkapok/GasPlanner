# Example Nitrox Maximum operational depth calculation

## Formulas

maximum operational depth pressure = partial pressure O2 / O2 fraction in mix

maximum operational depth = convert maximum operational depth pressure to depth

## Example

What is maximum operational depth for gas with 32 % oxygen at partial pressure 1.6 ?


O2 fraction of 32 % oxygen in the mix => 32 % O2 => 0.32 bar at surface

maximum depth pressure = 1.9 / 0.32 = 5 bar

maximum operational depth = 5 bar => (5 - 1)/ 10 = 40 meters
