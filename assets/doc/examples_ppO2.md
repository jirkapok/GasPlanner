# Example Nitrox partial pressure calculation

## Formulas

partial pressure O2 = pressure at depth * O2 fraction in mix

## Example

What is the partial pressure of oxygen for Ean50 at 22 meters?

O2 fraction in Ean50 => 50 % O2 => 0.5 bar at surface

22 meters => 22 / 10 + 1 = 3.2 bar

partial pressure O2 = 3.2 * 0.5 = 1.6 bar
