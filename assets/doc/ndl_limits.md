# No decompression limits

Use the same options like when planning normal dive. The shown No decompression limits (NDL) table represents for each depth maximum bottom time (including descent) after which diver reaches no decompression limit.
The table shows only depths between 12 - 42 m (40 - 130 ft), because below these depths no decompression limits are hard to reach or the dive becomes saturation dive. Maximum depth is limited by the oxygen percents and maximum partial pressure (ppO2) content as they define the maximum operational depth for selected gas mixture. Eg. for Ean32 and 1.4 ppO2 the maximum operational depth is 33 m (110 ft). And that is why the table does not show higher depths for this settings.
The values calculated here can be used as replacement for tables used by you agency. But you dont have pressure groups and remaining nitrogen, so it can be used only for first dive.
