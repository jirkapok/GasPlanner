# Why Dugong planner?

In our community, if you dive as sea horse with foot down, head up, kicking a lot, if you consume tank two times faster than others, if you kick up the silt or break corals, you have 10 kg (22 pounds) of lead ...

It is OK to be beginner. All of as we were there, but the key is to don't stop learning, try to be better diver, even not progressing to caves or deep depths. Still you want to the "bad ass" diver, right?
That is why target goal of this application is to educate divers. So, if you are diving as sea horse, `We say you are diving as a "Dugong"`.

By the way it is a nice animal, isn't it?
