# Altitude

The altitude diving calculator helps to estimate altitude from the current air pressure and based on the provided actual depth helps to estimate current depth. Eg. you are going to dive at altitude 300 m (100 ft) to 20 meters and you are going to use air tables for dives at sea level. So you can the use Theoretical sea level depth as adjusted target depth for your planned dive.
