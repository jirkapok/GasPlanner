# Events causing errors and warnings

In case of any issue with the plan, Notification messages are shown bellow the dive table colored by red for errors and yellow for warnings. Warning should be understood so that the dive isn't optimal and there is low risk of problems. Error means, that the plan doesn't make sense or probably will end in dead. There are also informative messages

| Event | Risk | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Not enough gas | Easy, right? | Provide more tanks, use larger tank or reduce planned depth or duration |
| High ppO2 | High content of oxygen increase risk of oxygen toxicity which may cause convulsions, drowning or dead | Use gas with lower oxygen content or reduce planned depth |
| Low ppO2 | At that point the gas is hypoxic and may cause drowning or dead, in case partial pressure of oxygen is bellow 0.18 | Use gas with higher oxygen content at these depths |
| High ascent speed | User defined part of the dive with high risk of micro-bubbles which cause higher risk of DCS | Enlarge the ascent duration |
| High descent speed | Higher risk of ear (or other cavities) barotrauma | Enlarge the descent duration |
| Broken ceiling | In user defined part of the dive profile you reach lower depth than current ceiling, which increases risk of DCS | Fix the profile, so always stay bellow the ceiling |
| Narcotic depth exceeded | Even the gas is breathe able at this depth, there is higher risk of gas narcotic effects. Usually this applies to deep air dives | Plan shallower dive or use gas for higher depths (Trimix) |
| Switch to gas with higher N2 content | There is a risk of Isobaric counter diffusion | Choose another decompression gas with lower nitrogen content |
| Long oxygen exposure causing 80 % of CNS limit reached | There is a risk of CNS toxicity symptoms | Choose gases with lower oxygen content or reduce target depth |
| Long oxygen exposure causing 80 % of OTU limit reached (260 OTU) | There is a risk of OTU toxicity symptoms | Choose gases with lower oxygen content or reduce target depth |
| High gas density | Causes high work of breathing and results in high partial pressures of arterial CO2, which can cause narcosis, hypercapnia and loss of consciousness. | Reduce target depth or use gas with higher helium content (i.e. lower density). |

> This is the main purpose of this application: to reduce these risks!
