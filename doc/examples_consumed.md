# Example Respiratory minute volume calculations

## Formulas

SAC =  RMV / tank size

consumed gas = SAC * average depth in bars * duration


## Example

How much gas did i use (in bars) at average depth 15 m, with tank 10 L for 45 minutes where my respiratory minute volume (RMV) was 20 L/min?

depth in bars =  15 / 10 + 1 = 2.5 bar (simplified depth conversion)

SAC = 20 / 10 = 2 bar/minute

consumed = 2 * 2.5 * 30 = 150 bars
