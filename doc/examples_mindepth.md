# Example minimum depth calculations

## Formulas

Minimum depth = Minimum ppO2 / oxygen fraction

Where minimum (breathable) partial pressure of oxygen (ppO2) is usually 0.18 bar.


## Example 1

Team selects Trimix 21/35 as a gas for the dive. What is the minimum depth for this gas?

Minimum depth =  0.18 / 0.21 = 0.86 < 1 b i.e. up to the surface.

## Example 2

Team selects Trimix 12/60 as a gas for a dive. What is the minimum depth for this gas?

Minimum depth = 0.18 / 0.12 = 1.5 b

1.5 b => minimum depth is 5 m.
