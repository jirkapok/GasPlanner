## Example redundancies calculations

## Formulas

final pressure = (first tank pressure * first tank size + second tank pressure * second tank size) / (sum of tank sizes) 

## Example

What is the final pressure in two tanks with different sizes and pressures?
First tank is 12 L (124.1 cuft) and contains 50 b (725 psi) only.
Second tank is 24 L (85 cuft) and contains 200 b (2900 psi).

Final pressure in both tanks will be the same:
(12 * 50 + 24 * 200) / (12 + 24) = 150 b (2175 psi)
