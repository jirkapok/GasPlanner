## Example Cylinder Balancing Calculation

## Formulas

final pressure = (first tank pressure * first tank size + second tank pressure * second tank size) / (sum of tank sizes)

## Example

What is the final pressure in two tanks with different sizes and pressures?

First tank is 12 L (124.1 cuft) and contains 50 b (725 psi) only.

Second tank is 24 L (85 cuft) and contains 200 b (2900 psi).

Final pressure in both tanks will be the same:

(12 * 50 + 24 * 200) / (12 + 24) = 150 b (2175 psi)
