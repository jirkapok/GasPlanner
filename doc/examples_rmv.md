# Example Respiratory minute volume calculations

## Formulas

SAC = consumed gas / (average depth in bars * duration)

RMV = SAC * tank size

## Example

During dive where average depth was 15 meters for 45 minutes i consumed 150 bars from 15 liter tank. What is my SAC and RMV?

depth in bars =  15 / 10 + 1 = 2.5 bar (simplified depth conversion)

SAC = 150 / (2.5 * 45) = 1.333 bar/minute

RMV = 1.333 * 15 = 20 liters/minute
