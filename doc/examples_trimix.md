## Example

You plan a dive to 45 meters (5.5 bar) and consider Air narcotic for depths below 30 meters (4 bar) and usable gas in range 0.18 - 1.4 ppO2. Team selects Trimix 21/35 as an option.

Minimum depth = Minimum ppO2 / oxygen fraction = 0.18 / 0.21 = 0.86 < 1 bar i.e. up to the surface

MOD = Maximum ppO2 / oxygen fraction = 1.4 / 0.21 = 6.6 bar => 56 meters

Equivalent narcotic depth = (1 - Helium fraction) * depth = 0.65 * 5.6 = 3.64 bar => 26.4 meters

Maximum narcotic depth = MOD / (1 - Helium fraction) = 4 / 0.65 = 6.15 bar => 51.5 meters

Result: Selected gas is good choice for target depth 45 meters, because its range is 0 - 51.5 m.
