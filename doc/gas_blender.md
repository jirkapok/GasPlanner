# Gas blender

This calculator helps to create gas mixes using partial pressures method for source tank (even with remaining gas in it) using top mix, oxygen and helium.
Results are show in separate table. This calculator uses ideal gas law.
The expected procedure is to empty, release or start with remaining gas.
Then add helium and oxygen and finally top with top mix up to the required pressure.

Simplified Example: 
Use air and oxygen only to mix 200 b of Ean32 to tank with 50 b of air.
Nitrogen in Ean32 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
Required nitrogen content = 200 * 0.68 = 136 b nitrogen
Nitrogen in Air = 1 - 0.21 = 0.79
Current nitrogen content = 50 * 0.79 = 39.5 b nitrogen
We need to add = 136 - 39.5 = 96.5 b nitrogen
i.e. We need to add = 96.5 / 0.79 = 122 b air
But first we add = 200 - 50 - 122 = 28 b oxygen
