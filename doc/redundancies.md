# Redundancies

This calculator allows you to combine gas from two tanks marked as `First tank` and `Second tank` using ideal gas law. Content of the gas does`nt matter, because here we focus on the gas volume only, not its content.
The result of combining the gas volume is shown in Final pressure. Both tanks will have the same pressure even not the same cylinder volume.
Since we are using ideal gas law for the calculation, keep in mind to combine the gas using slow flow to prevent pressure loses due to temperature increase.

Example:
First tank is 12 L (124.1 cuft) and contains 50 b (725 psi) only.
Second tank is 24 L (85 cuft) and contains 200 b (2900 psi).
Final pressure in both tanks will be the same:
(12 * 50 + 24 * 200) / (12 + 24) = 150 b (2175 psi)
