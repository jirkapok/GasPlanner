# Weight

The weight calculator helps to estimate required additional lead the diver needs to use to compensate weight lost during the dive as gas from provided tank is consumed. This does not count with protection suit weight compensation using additional lead. E.g. if you consume 150 b (2175 psi) from 15 L (125 cuft) tank, you will need to add 2.8 kg (6.1 lb) of lead to be neutrally buoyant. This calculator is based on assumption that 1 liter of dry air at 15 Â°C weights 1,225 g.
